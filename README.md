# VintedProject

Often it happens to throw our items even if they're in acceptable conditions, causing an encreasing of garbage amount. 
So, we thought to develop an e-commerce system that can allow you to sell items to other people who like or need them.

This course project is an e-commerce is called Vinted and it's based on (i.e. similar to) the popular Vinted platform.
It's composed by Users, who can sell and buy Products and also create a personal WishList where to save products they'd like to buy.
WishList has also a functionality of shopping cart so that it is possible to buy some products the users saved there.
After a purchase, buyer users can write reviews about sellers and products are removed from every wishlist where they were associated.

All transactions are saved in a database so that we can retrieve a list of products sold by every user.

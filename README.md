# VintedProject

Often it happens to throw our items even if they're in acceptable conditions, causing an encreasing of garbage amount. 
So, we thought to develop an e-commerce system that can allow you to sell them to other people who like or need them.

This e-commerce is called Vinted. (Or better, similar to him that we created for a course project)
It's composed by Users, who can sell and buy Products, they can also create a personal WishList where to save products they'd like to buy.
WishList has also a functionality of shopping cart so that is possible to buy some or all products users saved there.
After a purchase, buyer users can write reviews about seller users and products are removed from every wishlist where it's associated.

All transactions are saved in a database so that we can have a point of products' selled memorization.
